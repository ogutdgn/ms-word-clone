# Last Point — dated state checkpoints

> A running log of "where we are" at the end of each session/day. **Append a NEW dated entry at
> the TOP each time — never overwrite older entries.** The accumulated history shows our
> progression. Renewed via the `plan-tracking` skill. Big picture: [plan.md](plan.md) · session
> playbook + daily work log: [execution-map.md](execution-map.md).

## 2026-06-04
- **Branch:** `main` (the `research-architecture` line was merged via PR #8). Today's doc work
  is on `docs/dated-plan-logs`.
- **Phase:** Phase 0 complete → **Phase 1 (Scaffold) is next** — not started.
- **State summary:** all decision/research/plan docs are now on `main`. Architecture is locked
  (ADR-0001…0005) and de-risked (spike GREEN). No build work has started.
- **Done this session:**
  - Made "**never do code work on `main`** — create + checkout a feature branch first" an
    explicit rule in `plan.md` + `execution-map.md`.
  - Restructured `last-point.md` and `execution-map.md` into **dated logs** (append-only history
    + a daily work-log with checkboxes); updated the `plan-tracking` skill to match.
- **Next:** Phase 1 — scaffold electron-vite + TS, vendor the SuperDoc fork, mount the model in
  our own `EditorView` (see [execution-map.md](execution-map.md) → CURRENT PHASE).
- **Blockers/notes:** none. ⚠️ A docs commit (`a7cb0a8`) landed on `main` by mistake before the
  branching rule was internalized; from here, all feature/doc work goes on a branch.

## 2026-06-03
- **Branch:** `research-architecture` (later merged to `main` via PR #8).
- **Phase:** Phase 0 complete → Phase 1 next.
- **Done this session:**
  - Locked **ADR-0001…0005** (CUA pivot · ProseMirror model · fork SuperDoc's schema + converter
    + extensions · lists = paragraph+`numId` · `.docx` via the fork).
  - **De-risk spike GREEN** (`docs/research/2026-06-03-spike-superdoc-fork.md`): headless `.docx`
    round-trip with **no Vue**; model renders to clean DOM; dependency closure 185 pkg / 148 MB.
  - Created `docs/decisions/` (ADRs + `OPEN_DECISIONS.md`), `docs/architecture/`,
    `docs/research/`, `docs/plan/`, the `plan-tracking` skill; CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md banners;
    pushed the `research-architecture` branch.
- **Next:** Phase 1 scaffold.
- **Blockers/notes:** none.
